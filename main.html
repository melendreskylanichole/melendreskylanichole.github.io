	    of this information either graphically in the form of plans or numerically in the form of tables, and the setting out of measurements on the earth’s 
	    surface. It usually involves measurement, calculations, the production of plans, and the determination of specific locations. The surveyor may be called 
	    on to determine heights and distances; to set out buildings, bridges and roadways; to determine areas and volumes and to draw plans at a predetermined 
	    scale.</font>
